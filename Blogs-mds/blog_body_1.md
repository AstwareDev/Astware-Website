## Delayed Website & SentinelAPI Development

We're currently encountering an unresolved issue with deploying the backend of both our **Astware Website** and **SentinelAPI** services.

Everything functions perfectly in our **local development environment**, but once deployed to platforms like **Vercel** or **Railway**, the backend APIs return a **404 Not Found** error. This happens even though the deployments are successful and no build errors are reported.

### What We've Tried So Far

- **Reorganized the project structure** multiple times
- **Remade the entire backend and API codebase** from scratch
- Created and modified **vercel.json** configurations repeatedly
- Verified all file paths, routes, and deployment logs
- Switched frameworks and tested against alternate setups

Despite all of this, the deployed app consistently fails to locate and serve the backend routes or files that work locally without issue.

### What's the Problem?

We still don’t have a clear answer.

There are no descriptive error logs from the platforms—only generic 404 responses. It seems like the deployment environments are either not building the correct directory, ignoring our routes, or failing to route correctly to the handler files. None of the usual fixes work, and the problem isn’t reproducible outside of deployment.

### Why Two Blogs Are Identical

Since both the website and SentinelAPI share the same backend issues, the two blog posts are kept identical for clarity. We’re treating both as part of the same technical delay until further notice.
